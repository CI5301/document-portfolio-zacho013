## About

This is a template for the Digital Portfolio project in CI 5301.

This `repository` (in Github's term) contains a predefined structure for you to organize your files:

-- **data**: the folder where you put your data (and mock data)
-- **prez**: the folder where you put your presentation materials

Under each folder, there are place-holder files (such as data.csv) and you should replace them with your own.
